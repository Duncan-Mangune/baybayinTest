        The Philippine government has taken steps to revive and preserve Baybayin as part of the 
        nationâ€™s cultural identity. In the Senate, Senate Bill No. 1866 â€“ The National Writing 
        System Act seeks to promote, protect, and conserve Baybayin as a tool for cultural
         development. Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, the House Committee on Basic 
         Education and Culture has approved the proposal to declare Baybayin as the national writing 
         system of the Philippines, reinforcing its importance as a symbol of heritage and pride.
